# ML_Classification_PIMA_Indian_Diabetes
Assess classifier performance and shapely analysis on PIMA Indian Diabetes dataset
Overview
The aim of the project is to analyze different classifiers on the Pima Indian Diabetes dataset and compare the accuracy rates. In addition to compiling accuracy measures, another point of interest was to see which feature had the most significant contribution the overall accuracy.
Models
•	Knn
•	Logistic Regression
•	Naive Bayes
•	Support Vector Machine
Dataset
•	This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The data is from patients of Pima Indian heritage and are 21 years of age or older. The objective of the project is to predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. 
Target Variable
•	Outcome: 0 (no diabetes) or 1 (has diabetes)
Features/Predictor Variables
1.	Pregnancies - Number of times pregnant
2.	Glucose - Plasma glucose concentration
3.	BloodPressure - Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
4.	SkinThickness - Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
5.	Insulin - 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
6.	BMI - Body mass index
7.	DiabetesPedigreeFunction
8.	Age
